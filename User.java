 * User class represents a user entity in the Library Management System.
 * 
 * This class manages user information including authentication details, personal information,
 * role-based access control, and borrowing capacity management. Users can have different
 * roles (ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, MEMBER) with varying permissions and borrowing limits.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Role-based access control (Admin, Librarian, Member)
 * - Configurable borrowing capacity for members
 * - Transaction history tracking
 * - Active/inactive status management
 * - Borrowing limit enforcement
